# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Calorify

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project is about maintaining a healthy lifestyle by counting the calorie intake and giving personal goals on how much to be taken in a day.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We have made a desktop app which is about reducing weight and reaching the target goal, which suggests you how many calories to be burned by the user to achieve the target.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

-- Sarthak Pathak - tur84371@temple.edu
-- Siddh Bhatt - tuq32824@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The primary objective for the final project is to deliver a robust and user-friendly desktop app that accurately calculates personalized calorie targets based on their calories intake.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think we can probably add personalised workout plans based on the calorie intake of our users.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think if we can provide nutritional recipes to help our users reach their goals faster.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Functional coding will be done by Sarthak and the designing part would be done by Siddh. We will be working on it together towards the app so we can pour in ideas from both the sides and make the best we can do .
